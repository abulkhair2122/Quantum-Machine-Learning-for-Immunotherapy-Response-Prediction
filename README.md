# Quantum Machine Learning for Immunotherapy Response Prediction

This project leverages Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to predict patient responses to immunotherapy treatments. The model is designed to assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating patient data to determine the probability of response to treatment, facilitating personalized medicine in oncology.

## Project Overview
The model uses various clinical and genomic features to predict immunotherapy response. It is built with quantum-enhanced machine learning techniques, aiming to improve prediction accuracy for complex biological data.

### Features
- **Predictive Model**: Classifies patients as likely responders or non-responders to immunotherapy.
- **Data Input Options**: Allows both single-patient entry and batch processing via CSV upload.
- **Detailed Output**: Provides probability scores and predictions.
